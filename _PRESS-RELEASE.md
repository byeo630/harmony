There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  The MVP is called Harmony. It's an app that lets you listen to the song that your friend is listening to on Spotify.
  If that doesn't work out, it'll show you your friend's music tastes and how similar they are to yours.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Harmony is for music lovers who want to share the music they're listening to, and for those who want to tune into what their
  friends are listening to.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Harmony allows people to tune into the same music together allowing for either an intimate 1 on 1 shared music experience between two people,
  or a larger experience with more people in a room where there is a host or multiple hosts who control which song is being played. Music is meant
  to be shared, and Harmony allows this by tuning people into the same music to be experienced together.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Currently when listening to Spotify, Pandora, the radio, Soundcloud, etc., the listening experience is a very solitary unless you're playing it
  out loud for other people to hear. With Harmony, the listening experience is now able to be shared among multiple people across a network where
  everyone is listening together to the same song. It's kind of like how silent discos work, except across the internet.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Harmony allows people to share music with people they care about such as friends, family, significant others, in a way that allows for a shared experience
  of music. Previous ways of sharing music are to either share a link to a song, or to play it out loud with those people you'd want to share it with. With
  Harmony, you can now share music live from you own device.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  Harmony aims to bridge the gap between solitary music listening and listening to music with others. Music is its best when it's experienced with others, 
  and Harmony's goal is to bring people together through music.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  The MVP will try to access what a friend of a user is listening to, and play the same song. The end goal is to have the music in perfect sync, but the MVP
  will play a song a friend is listening to from the beginning, not where the friend is currently at in the song.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  'My brother keeps asking me for music recommendation, but now he can listen to the music I listen to with me!'
  'I used to make playlists and send them to my partner, but now we can listen to the songs I send him/her together, even when we're at work, working out,
  driving, and more!'

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Harmony aims to change the social landscape of listening to music, by allowing people to share their experience, just as music is meant to be experienced.
